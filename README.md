This repository contains all the CAD files for team 11995 TACA. This year, we fully transitioned to additive manufacturing based chassis and mechanisms. By adopting a modular chassis design, smaller printing beds can be accomodated. Additionally, this adds flexibility later on, for example, damaged sections can be replaced.
